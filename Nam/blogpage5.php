                    Association football or simply Football, Soccer is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams consisting of 11 players on each side.
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    It has around 250 million players in more than 200 countries and regions, making it the most popular sport in the world. 
                    It plays on a rectangular surface called a football field with a goal at each end. 
                    The goal is to score in the opponent's goal. 
                    The team with the most goals wins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Football is played according to a set of rules called the Laws of Football. 
                    The ball has a circumference of 68 to 70 cm (27 to 28 in). 
                    The two teams compete to put the ball into the opponent's goal (between the post and under the crossbar), thereby scoring. 
                    Players are not allowed to use their hands or touch the ball during play, with the exception of the goalkeeper in the penalty area. 
                    Other players mainly use their feet to attack or pass the ball, but can also use any other part of the body except the hands and arms. 
                    The team that scores more goals at the end of the game is the winner; If both teams score an equal number of goals, a tie is awarded or the game goes to extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the game. 
                    Each team is led by a captain, who has only official responsibility under the Rules of Football: to represent their team toss a coin before the start of a match or penalty shootout. 
                  </p>

                    World football is governed by the International Football Federation (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association), which organizes both men's and women's World Cups every four years. 
                    The FIFA Men's World Cup started in 1930, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 which were canceled due to World War II. 
                    Approximately 190 to 200 national teams compete in qualifying matches within each continental confederation for a place in the final round. 
                    The final round, held every four years, features 32 national teams competing over a four-week period (this number increases to 48 by 2026). 
                    It is the most prestigious men's soccer tournament in the world as well as the most watched and watched sporting event in the world, surpassing the Summer Olympics. 
                    Similarly, the FIFA Women's World Cup was held for the first time since 1991 although the sport has been played by women since its existence. 
                    A record 1.12 billion people watched the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

                  <p>
                    The most prestigious European club competitions are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract large television audiences around the world. 
                    The men's final is, in recent years, the most watched annual sporting event in the world. 
                    The top five men's national football championships in Europe are the Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), Bundesliga (Germany), Serie A (Italy) and Ligue 1 (France). 
                    Attracting most of the world's best players, each league has total wage costs in excess of £600 million/763 million euros/US$1.185 billion.

                  <p>Players, uniforms and referees:</p>
                  <p>
                    Each football match consists of two teams, each consisting of 11 official players on the field including 1 goalkeeper. 
                    The goalkeeper is the only one allowed to play the ball with his hands, but this is also limited to the penalty area in front of the goal held by the goalkeeper. 
                    Depending on the position, there are also different names, such as defender, midfielder, striker, ... and some other positions. 
                    In addition to the official number of players, each team also has a number of substitutes to replace when necessary, usually in an official football match, each team is only allowed to change 3 players. 
                    A player who is substituted will not be allowed to return to the field of play. 
                    The person who directs the team's tactics is the coach, this position is not a mandatory stipulation in the Laws of Football. 
                    Players' uniforms typically include t-shirts (with arms), shorts (shorts), knee-high socks, boots and gravure guards. 
                    Players playing on the field are prohibited from wearing, wearing or carrying objects that could pose a danger to opposing players such as bracelets, necklaces or watches. 
                    Due to the position where the hands are used and often have to fly to follow the ball, the goalkeeper is better equipped than other players. 
                    They usually wear long-sleeved T-shirts, gravure and elbow guards and goalkeeper gloves when playing. 
                    However, they often have to wear a different color shirt than the rest of the team and the opposing team's players so that the referee distinguishes the handball between the goalkeeper and other players. 
                    The captain of a football team is usually easily identifiable by wearing a band around his/her sleeve, known as the "captain's armband". 
                    Like many other team sports, football also uses a numbering system to better identify the players. 
                    Normally the number system from 1 to 11 will be used more commonly, but there are still many leagues or teams that allow players to choose a shirt number from 1 to 99. 
                    The goalkeeper usually gives the shirt " number 1" to compete.
