                    Learning is the process of acquiring new understandings, knowledge, behaviours, skills, values, attitudes and interests.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to learn is seen in humans, animals, and some machines; There is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plant species. 
                    Some learning is immediate, caused by a single event (e.g. cutting a finger while playing a knife), but many skills and knowledge are acquired through repeated experience. 
                    Changes caused by learning often last a lifetime, and it is difficult to distinguish learned material that appears to be "lost" from material that cannot be retrieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human learning begins at birth (which can even begin before birth) and continues until death as a result of ongoing interactions between people and their environment. 
                    The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, and pedagogy. 
                    Research in such fields has led to the identification of different types of learning. 
                    For example, learning may occur as a result of the environment, either a classical conditioned reflex, an active conditioned reflex, or the result of more complex activities such as play, which is found only in relatively intelligent. 
                    Learning can happen consciously or unconsciously. 
                    Knowing that an adverse event can neither be avoided nor escaped can lead to a condition known as acquired helplessness. 
                    There is evidence for prenatal human behavioral learning, where habits have been observed as early as 32 weeks' gestation, suggesting that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and ready for learning and memory to occur very early in development.
                </p>
                Play or play has been approached by some theorists as the first form of learning. 
                Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. 
                Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is key to children's development, as they make sense of the environment through the play of educational games. 
                However, for Vygotsky, play is the first form of language learning and communication and the stage where a child begins to understand rules and signs. 
                Success on the road of life is not only action but also understanding from learning from life and learning continuously. 
                "That's really learning. You will suddenly understand in a new way something you've known all your life" (Doris Lessing).
