                    Under the Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) ToyBiz agreement in 1993, Avi Arad of ToyBiz was appointed President and CEO of Marvel Films and New World Entertainment Inc. 
                    New World is the parent corporation of MEG and later a subsidiary of the Andrews Corporation. 
                    Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would launch Marvel Films including Marvel Films Animation.

                <p>Marvel Studios:</p>
                <p>
                    In August 1996, Marvel created Marvel Studios, a merger of Marvel Films, due to the sale of the new World Group Communications Inc., co-and Andrews Group subsidiary Marvel at film and television stations, to News Corporation.

                    Jerry Calabrese, president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and director of Toy Biz, were assigned parallel control of Marvel Studios. According to Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control pre-production by running scripts, hiring directors and cast characters, and providing packages to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. 
                    Arad said of the control objective: "When you start a business with a big studio, they're developing a hundred or 500 projects, you're completely lost, that's not working for us. We're not going to be. do it Time again." Marvel Studios has arranged a seven-year development contract with 20th Century Fox to expand the market in the United States and internationally. 
                    In December of the following year, Marvel Entertainment Group went through a reorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of an investment strategy. By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the final films X-Men (2000), Daredevil (2003), Elektra (2005) and Fantastic Four (2005). 
                    Unannounced projects include Prince Namor, based on the character Namor and directed by Philip Kaufman, and Mort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson and creator Mort Larry Hama. 
                    Marvel developed the Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for the Fox Kids Network for release in the fall of 1998. However, due to bankruptcy, the film was canceled after only character designs and a reel. One-minute ad.
