                Association football or simply Football, Soccer is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams consisting of 11 players on each side.
              </h2>
              <p>
                It has around 250 million players in more than 200 countries and regions, making it the most popular sport in the world. 
                It plays on a rectangular surface called a football field with a goal at each end. 
                The goal is to score in the opponent's goal. 
                The team with the most goals wins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Football is played according to a set of rules called the Laws of Football. 
                The ball has a circumference of 68 to 70 cm (27 to 28 in). 
                The two teams compete to put the ball into the opponent's goal (between the post and under the crossbar), thereby scoring. 
                Players are not allowed to use their hands or touch the ball during play, with the exception of the goalkeeper in the penalty area. 
                Other players mainly use their feet to attack or pass the ball, but can also use any other part of the body except the hands and arms. 
                The team that scores more goals at the end of the game is the winner; If both teams score an equal number of goals, a tie is awarded or the game goes to extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the game. 
                Each team is led by a captain, who has only official responsibility under the Rules of Football: to represent their team toss a coin before the start of a match or penalty shootout.

                The ability to learn is seen in humans, animals, and some machines; There is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plant species. 
                Some learning is immediate, caused by a single event (e.g. cutting a finger while playing a knife), but many skills and knowledge are acquired through repeated experience. 
                Changes caused by learning often last a lifetime, and it is difficult to distinguish learned material that appears to be "lost" from material that cannot be retrieved.
